The design patterns are cool! I tried to learn a few design patterns. But failed always. Itâ€™s hard to memorize and I forget easily ðŸ™„. At least I find it hard. But, recently I came to know a design pattern which is the Decorator Design Pattern. Before I dive into the code letâ€™s just have an understanding of what it is.

Suppose, you went to have burgers with your friends. The burger costs you $4. But you want to add some addons. Extra cheese & sauce. You may also like an extra patty. But they also require some extra cash to be paid. This is in terms of the design pattern called the Decorator Pattern. Itâ€™s still a burger but it requires some extra price to decorate. Letâ€™s dive into the code to get an idea.

class Article
{
    private $title, $time;

    function __construct($title, $time)
    {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->time = $time;
    }

    function getTitle()
    {
        $this->title;
    }

    function getTime()
    {
        $this->time;
    }

    function displayTitleTime()
    {
        $title = $this->getTitle();
        $date = date('Y/m/d H:i:s', $this->getTime());
        echo "{$title} was published date {$date}";
    }
}


class ArticleTimeDecorator
{
    private $article;

    function __construct(Article $article)
    {
        $this->article = $article;
    }

    function displayTitleTime()
    {
        $title = $this->article->getTitle();
        $date = $this->article->getTime();
        echo "{$title} was published {$date}";
    }

 


}


$article = new Article("This is a title", time() + 400);
// $a->displayTitleTime();
$ar = new ArticleTimeDecorator($article);
$ar->displayTitleTime();
